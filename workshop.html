<h4 id="yannorlareygrame">Yann Orlarey (Grame)</h4>

<p>An introduction to the Faust programming language (https://faust.grame.fr). The workshop will be based on online
    tools and it is recommended to have the latest version of Chrome installed for AudioWorklet and MIDI support.</p>

<h4 id="emmanueljourdanandsamtarakajianbothsoftwareengineersatcycling74">Emmanuel Jourdan and Sam Tarakajian, both
    Software Engineers at Cycling '74</h4>

<p>In this workshop, we’ll look at how to build some interesting audio components using gen~. The gen~ object provides
    some capabilities that Max cannot, and we’ll look at how these are useful when building audio tools. Finally, we’ll
    see how to take the exported code and use it in a simple target.</p>

<p>Before attending this workshop, you should download and install Max 8 from cycling74.com (a free demo is available,
    as is an inexpensive monthly subscription). Optionally, you should ensure that you have an application on your
    computer that can act as a VST plugin host. Max itself will fulfill this role, as will most DAW's. </p>

    Algorithms on the SHARC Audio Module developer boards (Room C156)</h3>

<h4 id="patscandalismofortejuliussmithstanforduraphaelpanis">Pat Scandalis (Moforte), Julius Smith (Stanford U.),
    Raphael Panis</h4>

<p>The recently released developer board for SHARC DSPs (SHARC Audio Module) has built-in framework support for
    compiling Faust algorithms to run natively on the board. The SHARC Audio Module has dual core 500MHz Griffin
    processor, stereo audio in/out and support for MIDI via a FIN daughter card. </p>

<p>This is a hands-on workshop on the steps needed to setup and use both the Faust and CCES tool chain for compiling
    Faust algorithms to the board. </p>

<h4 id="victorlazzarinideanoffacultyofartscelticstudiesandphilosophymaynoothu">Victor Lazzarini (Dean of Faculty of
    Arts, Celtic Studies and Philosophy, Maynooth U.)</h4>

<p>This workshop will look at how Csound can be used in the web platform, under the most common browsers. The JS APIs
    will be introduced along with a number of code examples.</p>

<p>The only requirement might be a text editor and a web browser. Familiarity with git might be good,
    as well as git itself, although this might not be completely required.</p>

    musical programming and modular synthesis workshop (Room C156)</h3>

<h4 id="martinklangrebeltech">Martin Klang (RebelTech)</h4>

<p>Welcome to the Rebel Technology musical programming and modular synthesis workshop. This workshop will serve as both
    an introduction to musical programming and music making with modular synthesisers, and as a showcase of some of the
    emerging, hybrid ways of working with computers and Eurorack modulars. We will also showcase some of our brand new
    products: Alchemist, Wizard and Magus, which were recently Kickstarted.</p>

<p>Rebel Technology make highly innovative and open source modular synthesizers in London since more than 8 years. They
    are the creators of the OWL which can run patches written by the user in Max Gen, Pure Data, FAUST or C++, allowing
    everyone to develop their own unique hardware instruments.</p>
