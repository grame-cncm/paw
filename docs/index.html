      <p>Programmable Audio Workshop on Procedural Audio : instead of playing recorded sounds in video games, Procedural
        Audio is about producing sounds algorithmically through real-time synthesis methods. These models can be
        controlled by various parameters, for example from the game engine in relation to the player's actions. The 6
        talks and 4 workshops of PAW 2021, will offer a unique opportunity to discover Procedural Audio in relation with
        video game engines!</p>



      <p>PAW is completely free, but the number of seats is limited. Register as soon as possible at <a

      <h4><a href="#robbio">Rob Hamilton</a> (Head of the Department of Arts, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA)
      </h4>

      <p>Over the past decade, consumer-based virtual reality hardware and software platforms have become significantly
        more
        affordable and accessible to the general public. At the same time, virtual and augmented reality development
        toolkits
        grounded in game and mobile application design paradigms have similarly become more user friendly, opening up
        opportunities for artists, musicians and creatives of all backgrounds to help shape the look, feel and, perhaps
        most
        importantly, the sound of the ‘metaverse’ writ large. This talk will explore the role of musicians and digital
        luthiers
        alike in the field of Musical XR, targeting the creation and composition of dynamic and procedural real-time
        musical
        instruments and systems.</p>

      </h4>

      <p>Tools like faust2unity greatly facilitate the use of Faust-written synthesizers and audio effects in Virtual
        Reality environments for procedural audio applications. Tighter connections can be established between what is
        seen and what is heard in these environments through the use of physical modeling. For instance, mesh2faust can
        convert a 3D mesh designed in any CAD software (i.e., SolidWorks, Blender, Rhino, OpenSCAD, etc.) or VR
        environment into a modal physical model implemented in Faust through finite element analysis. In this
        presentation, after giving some general background on the use of physical modeling in the context of procedural
        audio and VR, we demonstrate how 3D graphical objects can be turned into ready-to-use audio physical models
        using mesh2faust.

      <p>The workshop is a practical introduction to procedural audio and Faust programming. Different techniques of
        sound synthesis will be explored using in particular the new Faust physical modeling libraries. The workshop
        does not require the installation of any software except a recent web browser like Firefox or Chrome. All
        examples will be programmed directly in the web using the Faust IDE (https://faustide.grame.fr).</p>

      <h4><a href="#stefaniabio">Stefania Serafin</a> (Professor of Sonic Interaction Design, Aalborg University)</h4>

      <p>In the last decades several physical modelling techniques have been developed, such as waveguide models,
        mass-spring simulations, modal synthesis and finite difference schemes, to name a few. Moreover, these
        techniques have already been implemented in different software platforms such as Max, Faust, Juce, Super
        Collider, as well as commercial products such as SWAM by Audio Modelling. In this workshop we will look at
        recent developments in modelling musical instruments, discussing advantages and disadvantages of the different
        techniques. We will examine available tools and choose one case study to examine in depth.</p>

        In this presentation, we are going to add a .dsp object as an audio source in Unreal, procedurally spawn
        instances of
        it, and procedurally set parameters on those instances to create a diffuse, procedurally generated audiovisual
        experience. Before this presentation starts it is recommended that you install Unreal Engine 5 and have some way
        to
        compile `faust2api` on your computer.

      </h4>

      <p>For artists and designers seeking to build software-based dynamic and procedural audio and music systems, Epic
        Games’ Unreal 4 gaming engine offers a robust and battle-tested codebase optimized for real-time multi-user
        interaction. Capable of rendering visual assets with astonishing clarity and realism, Unreal 4 also boasts
        native Open Sound Control (OSC) support, as well as a suite of native procedural audio components for real-time
        audio synthesis. This workshop will explore the use of Unreal Engine 4 for building interactive musical systems
        using Unreal’s Blueprint workflow programming environment, OSC, and Unreal’s own synthesis components.</p>

      <p>Michaël Bolufer, director, writer, technical director at Plip! Animation and Studio Manette.Michaël has been
        working for almost 20 years between the animation and video game industries. In this "industrial in-between", he
        created in 2016 "Mr.Carton", the first series made with a game engine. Since then, he has participated in many
        series and VR film projects as a "real-time" technical art director.In 2020 he co-founded with Thibault Noyer
        the production company Plip! Animation and Studio Manette (in association with Caribara Animation), a studio
        specialized in the production of real-time films. He also continues to write and direct.</p>

      <p>Ethan Geller met Romain, Yann and Stephane in 2013 and has considered Faust his favorite audio programming
        language
        ever since. Currently, he is a software engineer in the Reality Labs Audio Research division of Meta. Previously
        he has
        worked on audio render systems for Fortnite, Unreal Engine, Dolby Laboratories and Playstation. Ethan has also
        written
        chapters on spatial audio topologies and multithreaded audio processing for Game Audio Programming 2 and Game
        Audio
        Programming 3.</p>

      <h4 id="robbio"><a href="#bobbio">Rob Hamilton</a></h4>
      <p>Composer and researcher Rob Hamilton explores the converging spaces between sound, music and interaction. His
        creative practice includes mixed and virtual-reality performance works built within fully rendered networked
        game environments, procedural music engines and mobile musical ecosystems. His research focuses on the cognitive
        implications of sonified musical gesture and motion and the role of perceived space in the creation and
        enjoyment of sound and music. Dr. Hamilton received his Ph.D. from Stanford University’s Center for Computer
        Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) and currently serves as Associate Professor of Music and Media and Head
        of the Department of Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY, USA.</p>

      <h4 id="gabrielbio"><a href="#gabrielbio">Gabriel Malgouyard</a></h4>

      <p>Gabriel Malgouyard is a software artisan, contributing to real-time multimedia projects. From sound design
        tools
        crafters LeSound to AAA video games studio such as Arkane, he learned the trade of game engines - Unity, Unreal
        and
        others - by taking part in traditional video games and VR pieces development.
        His interest now lies in widening the scope of these tools as actual media creation platforms to reach new
        domains, from
        films production to interactive educational models and more.</p>

        National de Création Musicale in Lyon (France), and a lecturer at the Center for Computer Research in Music and
        Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University (USA). He has been involved in the development of the Faust programming
        language since 2008 and he's part of the core Faust development team at GRAME. Besides that, Romain's research
        interests involve embedded systems for real-time audio processing, Human Computer Interaction (HCI), New
        Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), and physical modeling of musical instruments. He is currently leading
        the FAST project (https://fast.grame.fr) on facilitating the programming of FPGA platforms for real-time audio
        signal processing applications towards ultra-low latency.</p>
