      <h1 id="about"><b>PAW 2023</b><br><i>AI and Audio Programming Languages</i><br><small>Marie Curie Library, INSA Lyon (France)<br>Dec. 2, 2023</small></h1>

      <p>The Programmable Audio Workshop (PAW) is a yearly one day FREE event gathering members of the programmable audio community around scientific talks and hands-on workshops. The 2023 edition of PAW is hosted by the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/emeraude">INRIA/INSA/GRAME-CNCM Emeraude Team</a> at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/k8NDxRkdSZZCmTG67">Marie Curie Library of INSA Lyon</a> (France) on December 2nd, 2023. The theme of this year's PAW is "Artificial Intelligence and Audio Programming Languages" with a strong focus on computer music languages (i.e., Faust, ChucK, and PureData). The main aim of PAW-23 is to give an overview of the various ways artificial intelligence is used and approached in the context of Domain Specific Languages (DSL) for real-time audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP).</p>

      <p>PAW is completely free, but the number of in-person seats is limited. If you wish to attend PAW in person, please, register as soon as possible at <a href="https://forms.gle/ALfpkYEoC3GGpaWy9">PAW 2023 REGISTRATION</a>. PAW will also be streamed and recorded. A streaming link will be posted on this website soon before the event (there's no need for you to register if you plan on attending PAW remotely).</p>

      <h2 id="braun-talk"><b>09:30:</b> <a href="#braun">David Braun</a> — Machine Learning with Faust and JAX</h2>

      <p>In most examples of modern machine learning, ML practitioners use Python to design complex mathematical models that can be auto-differentiated and then optimized via stochastic gradient descent in order to maximize some objective. Audio engineers, however, don't use Python because it lacks the elegant syntax and powerful libraries of an audio domain-specific language (DSL) such as Faust. We present a pipeline which is one of the first of its kind to bridge the gap between a library-rich audio DSL and a powerful auto-diff ML framework. This Faust-to-<a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JAX</a> pipeline allows audio engineers to auto-differentiate DSP functions that would have been too time-consuming to re-implement in Python or difficult to differentiate manually.  Once Faust code is converted to JAX, the XLA compiler produces well-optimized code that scales well in cloud-computing systems. We present several early experiments showing our pipeline's potential to optimize audio-related objectives.</p>

      <h2 id="betancur-talk"><b>11:20: </b><a href="#betancur">Celeste Betancur</a> — (X)AI in Live Coding Environments: Pandora’s Dream</h2>

      <p>Pandora's Dream is a versatile live coding playground that opens up a world of possibilities integrating CHAI - Chuck for AI, openGL and the Chuck language. Pandora's Dream is an use case of all the new possibilities to use simple and explainable machine learning and AI models and integrate them into live performances. With this in mind is possible to analyze and extract audio features such as Chroma, MFCC, Centroid (and many others) and then train models such as KNN, HMM, SVN and MLP (also the new Wekinator object). In this case, importance is given to the complementary that the system can give to the performance and not to the algorithms itself. Actually, the features, algorithms, and data used are not the most advanced or sophisticated and in the end, the model is dependent on the performer's decisions. Pandora's Dream is centered in musical abstract data and not in the generation of audio at a sample by sample level. Finally, it is important to notice that all the training stages can be done and redone during the live performance to adjust, limit or expand the model. </p>

      <h2 id="carre-talk"><b>12:00: </b><a href="#carre">Benoît Carré</a> — AI and Music Composition</h2>

      <p>Artificial intelligence is useful in tools dedicated to the production of music, such as sound processing, the audio separation of instruments or virtual instruments like Inspired by Nature in Ableton Live. A.I. was in the news when musicians posted "fake Drake songs" online. Voice cloning technology is the latest, most visible and spectacular advance. But what are its limitations? Is A.I., already very powerful for voice generation, equally effective for composition? What does it lack to produce 8 really interesting bars from start to finish? What is the state of the art in text-2-music A.I.? What does it need to attract musicians en masse? And what about database annotation? What about the results it offers in the subsequent interaction? These are all questions I ask myself as I experiment with these tools. I'll share a few examples that illustrate my explorations, and we can discuss the limitations and potential they inspire.</p>

      <h2 id="braun">David Braun</h2>

      <p>David Braun is a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Princeton University. David has a prior background in software development of real-time computer graphics and audio. After graduating from Brown University in 2014, he used TouchDesigner to develop interactive art installations in his hometown of Chicago for Leviathan Design, which later became Envoy Inc. In 2020, David ventured into audio by entering the MST program at Stanford University in affiliation with the Center for Computer Research in Music & Acoustics. There he learned about machine learning and Faust. During his Ph.D. research, he hopes to remain an interdisciplinary researcher who uses and builds tools such as Faust that push the boundaries of creativity.</p>

      <h2 id="betancur">Celeste Betancur</h2>

      <p>Celeste Betancur is a multi-instrumentalist musician with a professional degree in guitar from Berklee College of Music and a Master's in digital arts. She's currently working towards her PhD at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University. She works at developing human-machine interfaces, especially designing programming tools and coding environments for musical expression. With these tools she performed live audiovisual sets around the world in more than 20 countries.</p>

      <h2 id="carre">Benoît Carré</h2>

      <p>Benoit Carré, also known as SKYGGE, stands at the forefront of musicians who are exploring the creative possibilities of artificial intelligence (A.I.). Since 2015, he has been collaborating with research teams (Sony CSL, CTRL Spotify), assisting them in the development of A.I. prototypes specifically designed for musicians. His work serves as a bridge between innovation and the realm of pop music creation. His musical experiments with the prototypes give rise to artistic projects and new concepts, such as orchestrating a cappella folk songs from the American repertoire using a tool that is currently in the development phase.</p>

      <p><b>2016:</b> "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o">Daddy’s Car</a>" a song composed with Flow Machines in the style of The Beatles<br>
      <b>2018:</b> "Hello World" a collaborative album (including <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12-QuZYojjLMLqwm5D-koV87MEcnNzozc/view?usp=share_linkicielx7WvWEcKYyAmU/view?usp=sharing">Stromae</a>) making SKYGGE  one of the first artists to create pop music entirely using A.I. technologie.<br>
      <b>2019:</b> "<a href="https://thequietus.com/articles/27142-benoit-carre-skygge-interview-american-folk-songs-artificial-intelligence">American Folk Song</a>," five a cappella folk songs orchestrated with A.I.<br>
      <b>2022:</b> Benoit Carré, along with his partner Céline Garcia, co-founded the label Puppet Master. Under this label, his album "Melancholia" was released, and a live performance titled "<a href="https://www.skygge.fr/en/interface-poetry-en/">Interface Poetry</a>" was produced in collaboration with digital artists OYE.<br>
