      <h3 id="bela-workshop">14:00-15:00, Bela Workshop (Room C156)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#temprano">Adan Benito Temprano</a> and <a href="#guidi">Andrea Guidi</a> (Bela -- UK, London)</h4>

      <p>Bela is a maker platform for creating beautifully responsive audio and interactive applications.</p>
      <p>This hands-on workshop will give an overview on how to create interactive musical embedded projects using our
        platform, showcasing some of the most useful features of Bela, such as the browser-based development
        environment, a built-in oscilloscope, sensor connectivity capabilities and support for many programming
        languages.</p>
      <p>No special requirements are needed, just bring a computer with a working web browser on it, headphones and you
        are all set, we will provide Bela kits, breadboards and other electronics.</p>

      <h3 id="webaudio-workshop">14:00-15:00, WebAudio Plugins Workshop (Room C157)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#buffa">Michel Buffa</a> (Université de la Côte d'Azur -- Sophia Antipolis, France)</h4>

      <p>In this session we will start by presenting the WAP standard (WebAudio Plugins, aka VSTs for the Web),
        which was designed by a group of people including FAUST authors, traditional C++ audio developers, and teams
        specialized in Web technologies. Thus, this WAP standard allows to write audio plugins in various languages:
        JavaScript of course, but also C/C++ and DSLs like FAUST via compilation to the new high performance WebAssembly
        standard. The presentation will focus on the new online version of the FAUST IDE, showing how without touching
        the code you can test and publish 100% functional WebAudio plugins directly from the IDE and use them in online
        host software such as a virtual pedalboard for guitarists or a DAW online. In last July, we challenged
        ourselves: write and publish a plugin per day during 21 days, reusing and adapting existing FAUST code. In the
        end, 21 days was too much, and we produced more plugins than expected!</p>

      <h3 id="embedded-workshop">15:00-16:00, Programming audio DSP on microcontroller-based boards (Room C156)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#michon">Romain Michon</a> (GRAME-CNCM -- Lyon, France)</h4>

      <p>Faust can now be used to program a wide range of embedded platforms to carry out real-time audio DSP tasks. In
        particular, an effort was made in recent years to target powerful microcontroller-based boards such as the
        Teensy and the ESP-32. Despite some limitations (e.g., computational power, memory, etc.), this type of chip
        offers many advantages over systems used traditionally for real-time audio DSP (e.g., DSPs, embedded Linux
        systems, etc.) such as boot time, ultra-low latency, price, etc. In this short tutorial, we'll walk you through
        the steps of programming a Teensy 4.0 and an ESP-32-based board (TTGO T-Audio) with Faust to implement
        synthesizers and audio effects. Finally, we'll demonstrate towards the end of the workshop how Faust can be used
        to program other types of embedded systems such as Android smartphones.</p>

      <h3 id="arrp-workshop">15:00-16:00, Sound synthesis and analysis with Arrp (Room C157)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#leben">Jakob Leben</a> (Limbic Media -- Victoria, Canada)</h4>

      <p>The workshop will introduce the unique syntax of the Arrp language which allows almost literal translation of
        mathematical equations for signal processing into code. The support for multi-dimensional signals and signals
        with different rates enables intuitive implementation of audio synthesis, processing as well as analysis
        algorithms. Function polymorphism supports implementation of highly reusable functions. Participants will be
        able to try Arrp in an online programming environment using a web browser, but limited to short input and output
        streams in text format. It will be demonstrated how to use Arrp to process sound files or real-time audio, and
        how to integrate the C++ code generated by the Arrp compiler into larger projects. A ready-to-use Arrp compiler
        for Linux and Mac OS will be available for download, and participants are encouraged to have installed a C++
        compiler with support for C++17.</p>

      <h3 id="spat-workshop">16:00-17:00, Sound spatialization with Faust: from stereo to VBAP (Room C156)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#lecomte">Pierre Lecomte</a> (Université Lyon 1 -- Lyon, France)</h4>

      <p>In this workshop, we will review the laws of stereophony and the Vector Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP) sound
        spatialization technique. From the theory, we will program several plugins with Faust, to spatialize sound
        sources on a loudspeaker array.</p>

      <h3 id="soul-workshop">16:00-17:00, Building and deploying SOUL effects and synths (Room C157)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#storer">Julian Storer</a> and <a href="#ferrari">Cesare Ferrari</a> (ROLI -- London, UK)</h4>

      <p>We'll walk through the process of building a chorus and a monosynth in SOUL, with attendees following along
        using either the web playground, the command-line tools, or Tracktion Waveform as their IDE. Towards the end of
        the workshop, we're hoping to be able to bring some guest hardware on which we can run people's creations!</p>

      <h3 id="livecoding-workshop">17:00-18:00, Introduction to live-coding with TidalCycles (Room C156+C157)</h3>

      <h4><a href="#herrou">Agathe Herrou</a> (Lyon, France)</h4>

      <p>TidalCycles is a programming language derived from Haskell for the live-coding of music. This workshop will be
        an introduction to the different notions used in pattern-based live-coding, and to the TidalCycles language
        (including a crash course in Haskell). Some experience in programming in general, and in particular functional
        programming, would be a definite plus, but the workshop will be designed to be accessible to non-coders as well.
      </p>
      <p>Ressources: It would be better for attendees to have TidalCycles installed. Installation instructions can be
        found here (<a
          href="https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Installation">https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Installation</a>).
        Materials from the course will be available at <a
          href="https://agathe.herrou.fr/tidal/">https://agathe.herrou.fr/tidal/</a>
