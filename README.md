Today, musicians and digital artists have no limits on their use of new technologies. They cross the boundaries of traditional computer platforms and instruments to create hybrid systems, embracing a broad range of mediums. These mediums are all very different, but they do have something in common - they’re all programmable. Some platforms have a lot of memory and CPU power, while others have very limited resources and therefore must be programmed with care. 

PAW is a unique opportunity to discover the latest developments in programmable audio boards and devices : Bela (Augmented Instruments Ltd), Touché (Expressivee), MOD (MOD devices), OWL (RebelTech) and, SAM (Analog Devices and Moforte). But PAW is also a place where these devices and specialized audio programming tools meet. Discover Antescofo (IRCAM), Csound (Csound community), Faust (Grame), GEN (Cycling74), JUCE (ROLI) and Kronos (V. Norillo).

Attend to a series of talks and practical hands-on workshops given by leading designers, researchers and entrepreneurs in the field!
